# Public Assets

This folder contains static assets that will be served directly.

## Adding Your Logo

1. Place your logo file in this folder (recommended formats: PNG, SVG, JPG)
2. Name it `logo.png` (or `logo.svg`, `logo.jpg`)
3. Update `components/RevOrgsLogo.tsx` and set `hasCustomLogo = true`
4. The logo will automatically be used throughout the site

## Recommended Logo Specifications

- **Format**: PNG with transparency or SVG
- **Size**: At least 200x200px for high-resolution displays
- **Background**: Transparent (recommended)
- **Aspect Ratio**: Square (1:1) works best

## Current Logo
